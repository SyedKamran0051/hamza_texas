# Wiener Schnitzel Houston Website Replica

This is a replica of the Wiener Schnitzel Houston website created for demonstration purposes. The website showcases the Wiener Schnitzel locations in Houston, their menu offerings, community initiatives, and contact information.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file for the website
- `css/styles.css` - CSS styles for the website
- `js/script.js` - JavaScript functionality for the website
- `assets/` - Directory containing all images used in the website

## Features

- Responsive design that works on all device sizes
- Interactive navigation with smooth scrolling
- Location information with directions
- Menu showcase with images and descriptions
- Community initiatives section
- Contact form
- Mobile app promotion section

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the website.

## Notes

This is a static website that mimics the design and content of the original Wiener Schnitzel Houston website. No backend functionality is implemented as this is only a landing page replica.

The images used are placeholders and would need to be replaced with actual images from Wiener Schnitzel for a production website.
